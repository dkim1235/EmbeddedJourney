installing icarus verilog took a long time.
I don't know why but i got pigeon holed into installing java but I don't remember why.
It took 2-3 days of debug and it's because I didn't set the correct JAVA_HOME in my .zshrc.

problem:
java was compiling with the latest version of java (18), 
but was running the program in an older version of java(8)

correct JAVA_HOME PATH set:
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

I believe i needed java for autoconf. There was something wrong with how my iverilog was compiling.

now i'm downloading gtkwave as my wave viewer. I didn't realize this is what i needed, but here we are.

iverilog -o csa_adder.vvp csa_adder_tb.sv
vvp csa_adder.vvp
