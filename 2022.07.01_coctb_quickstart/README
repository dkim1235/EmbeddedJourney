in this example, it took all day to make work. 
There were multiple installations of anaconda and python in my system. 
It looks like the latest macos OS monterry for the M1 macbook already has a version of python3 installed (3.8)

I also recall during my gradschool times, I installed a barebones version of anaconda for python and ML courses.
This is because the M1 chip just came out with ARM64 arch and was not working.

I uninstalled all versions of anaconda in my local area and in homebrew, and i installed it through homebrew because homebrew is a great tool for version control.
