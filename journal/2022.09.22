I really enjoy working on this project.
The problem is, when I stare at my laptop with my current work environment, I can't start. I have a very difficult time accomplishing or starting tasks.
I'm not sure why.
When I start working on this project, I can't stop. I really enjoy it. 
I noticed this, and I need to understand why. I need to bring the same level of joy in my current job. 
Especially since it's not too different than what I'm doing here now.

I've also made the decision to use cocotb as my verification tool/methodology.
I was thinking about using UVM, but I want to learn how to use cocotb. It is known to be powerful and it's the main verification methodology used by major hedgefunds.
